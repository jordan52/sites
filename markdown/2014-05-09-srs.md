<http://rs.io/2014/04/05/anki-10000-cards-later.html> is a nice write up on how to use spaced repetition learning ( SRS ) and anki. I like his thoughts on what kind of things to put on the cards, how to write them so you will remember the topics from several angles, and what to put in your deck (don't just memorize state capitals... that's something I did when I first started and I quickly quit because it wasn't interesting or useful.)
