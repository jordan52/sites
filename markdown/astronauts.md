We were sitting on a platform surrounded by water with no land in sight. The air was crisp and still and it was good. My dangling foot was the only thing moving for miles and the starlit sky reflected perfectly in the shiny black water. It seemed like the stars were all around us. We were somehow holding hands and after a short burst of shooting stars the earth melted away at our sides and it was as if we were floating in space. 

In a way, we all are.

It started out as the kind of trip that needed real flashlights instead of apps. Almost none of us knew where we were going and there was no moon. There was only the fog of our breath, bare trees, and old roads. Nick called out from up ahead, 
"Hol-lee shite. We finally made it! The barn is just down this gravel path." I heard rocks slip behind me. Sam cried out, "OZARK!" and everyone laughed. Ozark was the perfect expletive for anyone who had just spent four hours lost on the back roads of Missouri looking for a party.

The barn was down that path and the party was just beyond in a 10 acre clearing that was already packed with people. Headlights and bonfires lit the field and girls danced in truck beds and guys watched and literally hollered. Everyone was young and dumb and by time we arrived I was stupid drunk. I smiled, threw my arms up and broke away from my friends. I was meeting people. I think I met everyone but most importantly, I met her. I never did ask her name. 

She was pretty and all I know for sure is she asked why I had a box of wine. I pulled the silver bag out of the box and yelled, "Because it is SPACE WINE!" She asked if I had ever been to space and I said no and she asked if I'd like to and I said yeah. She paused to really look at me. Her bottom lip caught on her left lateral incisor and her eyes were green and she said, "Come with me?" She paused to touch my antecubital fossa, "I have something for you."

Then we were in her shitty car and listening to bands I didn't know. I stopped myself from asking where we were going or why her left arm was in a cast. She threw trash out her window and drove quickly. Soon we were off main roads and driving past "no trespassing" signs. She stopped at a gate and got out to open it. I thought maybe I should run but I didn't. We drove up what seemed like an old mining road. Up and up and then she stopped and turned off the car.

"Can you swim?" she asked.

"Yes."

"Good. Get out." She threw open her door and hopped out so I did too.

There were wires and concrete buildings. It looked like we were at some sort of electric plant at the top of an Ozark mountain. It was dark. The only sound was gravel crushing under our shoes.

"What is this place?" I asked.

"It is kind of a gigantic battery." She said. "The electric company pumps water into the upper reservoir at night and then uses it to push turbines during the day. It is offline right now." She pointed to a ladder that led up the side of the reservoir. "We are going up there." 

We climbed.

At the top was a thin section of concrete that jutted into the water like a pier. We walked to the very end and sat next to each other. The reservoir was full almost to the top and we must have been on the tallest mountain in the area. There was nothing to see but sky and what seemed like the biggest infinity pool ever built.

I started to say something. She raised her index finger to pouted lips and said, "shhhhhhhhhh, just watch." And I did and the earth melted away and I felt like we were awash in a sea of stars - some falling, some shooting, and she pulled me in to her with an unbroken arm.
 
That was my second trip to outer space.

I thought about that night while I was sitting on a rooftop, waiting for the sun to rise. I always loved being _in_ the sky. I guess that's why I spent those lost days on roofs instead of somewhere else. The sun was rising and a ladder popped up from below. Boots - solid, handmade boots - clanged up ladder rungs. My boss' head popped up over the edge.

"How long have you been up here?" he asked.

"A while." I replied, "Is it time to begin?"

"Yeah.”

He threw me a scraper and with one fluid motion I grabbed it out of the air and started tearing off shingles. There was a rhythm to it - 

scrape-lift.  pull-throw.
scrape-lift.  pull-throw.
scrape-lift.  pull-throw.
scrape-lift.  pull-throw. 

A good roofer could annihilate one square every three minutes.I was faster than most back then. After the first pass pulling shingles we had to take a second pass. You know, to pull fragments and nails. We had to get the roof clean, almost pristine. It took a few hours to get that far. By then, the sun was high enough to paint the air over our heads with a washed out blue gradient. Streaks of light shot out though low clouds like searchlights looking for (what?) in this suburban town. The third pass drove leftover nails flat into the plywood. Clean slate, good foundation. The sun was higher now which turned the dew to humidity and softened the tar. It made my boots stick, like walking on some sort of rancid taffy. We rolled tar paper across the roof and went to work. 

Set-square.  roll-tack.
Set-square.  roll-tack.
Set-square.  roll-tack.
Set-square.  roll-tack.
Cut. done.

We took breaks for water. Warm water that tasted like the inside of an old, plastic cooler. The sun was baking and in minutes we were back on the roof with nail guns, kneepads and boots, setting shingles. More noise, more rhythm. This time a symphony of tack-tack-tack drop, tack-tack-tack drop, tack-tack-tack drop. Three hits per shingle. 50 shingles in a square and we were on a 45 square roof. 

I listened and counted to keep my thoughts at bay. 6,750 tacks with an average of 12 nail gun misfires per square. 500 nails per clip gave pause to reload before another set of tack-tack-tack until the edge. Edges meant cut shingles and typically 2 nails but edges slowed the rhythm and any trash was pushed over the edge.
The process continued and my mind went blank. I finally quit counting as we broke for a quick lunch of cool coffee, funyuns and pork rinds and right back up on the roof with more tack-tack-tack. Thinking stopped.

Blank.

This life.

When I came to, I noticed a truck idling in the driveway. My Casio watch said 1:09 PM and we only had 9 Squares to go. TACK-TACK-TACK drop. The driver was in his air-conditioned cab and I could hear the speaker phone through rolled-up windows. We called him boss even if he wasn't. Formalities don't matter much in this business. 

Roofers. 

We started early to avoid the heat. We drank from dirty hoses and generally did our best to lay low. Stats on this crew: 

67% were less than 8 months out of prison. 
Median age - 24.5 years. 
93% were alcoholics. 
23% were illegal. 
One was an animal. 
Methamphetamines? weed? heroin? cocaine? Yes. 

I stood on the roof’s edge and watched ‘boss’ mouth words into his phone. I was dizzy with heat and shaking for something to drink and I waved and swayed. The first breeze of the day evaporated the sweat on my neck and I pulled my sweat soaked shirt away from my skin.

He rolled his window down and yelled, "Ese. Come down here, por favor."

So, I did. 14 rungs down the ladder and I walked in the shade and stood on his passenger side where there was more shade. His window came down slowly and cool air (smelled of tobacco and _Cool Water_ or maybe _Drakkar Noir_ or maybe Polo. I'm not sure.) rushed from the cab and twisted into the heat which further twisted into the sun's heat. Cycle, repeat.

"How's it going up there, Chief?" he asked. 

“Good.”
"Are you going to finish today?"

"Yes, sir. The underlayment was in good shape and we didn't find any leaks. We will be done by three or four at the latest." I said.

He tilted his head, just a bit, “Well then, ok. How is the crew today?"

"We're doing very well, thank you. Alejandro's back is healing nicely. I think he'll be 100% in a week or two."

"That was a nasty fall, wasn't it?" he said.

"Yes." I said.

He paused, just for a bit and then said, "Do you mind if I ask you a question?"

"Go ahead."

"I don't know how to ask this, but you don't talk like you look. How is your accent so good?"

"I'm from Madison.” I said. “Adopted when I was a baby. My parents are white as can be."

"That explains a lot. What are you doing out here working on roofs?" he asked.

"I found my biological parents a few years ago in Mexico. I have a brother. He needs money to go to school. So, I'm out here working and sending the money home to him. A couple of the guys on this crew know my real family."

—--
this is not yet written:
The man, who confesses to being adopted, also, says he never met his biological parents and asks how this kid found his.
—--

"Huh." He handed me an envelope. "Here's tomorrow's job. Take care."

"You too."

Boss put his truck in reverse and backed down the driveway. 14 rungs and I was on the roof. 1:19pm. 9 squares to go. TACK-TACK-TACK. drop. TACK-TACK-TACK-SNAP. I shouldn't have said Madison. TACK-SNAP-SNAP. A cloud broke the sun. SNAP-SNAP-SNAP. My hangover was finally going away. SNAP-SNAP-SNAP. water. scrape. place. tack tack tack. scrape. place. tack tack, etc.

Thinking didn’t stop.

I promised not to tell.

SNAP-SNAP-SNAP

Why did I say Madison?

I should have changed the names.

Why not?

Why can't I tell?

She was gone.

and, she was gone.

I felt like something inside was snapping.

Why the hell not.

8 more squares to go...

Running Away

----

He left and we worked the rest of the day finishing and cleaning the site. 

I found myself lying on a futon mattress spread out on a wood floor, trying to sleep. My hands hurt. I hurt. Nowhere near sleep I thought:

_I shouldn't have said Madison._

I got up. The room was dark but the moon was out. I could see just well enough to pull on my jeans, find my glasses, hat, and get to the door without crashing into anything or stepping on anyone. Five of us shared that room. It wasn't a big deal if i woke anyone up but I didn't want to hassle anyone and it probably made it be better when they realized I was gone. I imagine they wondered what time I dissappeard. I liked that for some reason. It was striking somehow. Some sort of mystery, I guess. It was silly. I knew it was silly, but I try. Always try. I checked my pockets: Wallet. Keys. Phone. Ear plugs. I was ready to run.

Jacket went on. Door opened. I slipped outside and slowly pulled the door closed. I kept the door handle turned and released it slowly so the catch didn't click. There was a squeak, but definitely nothing loud enough for anyone to care.

I walked.

Porch to steps to driveway to sidewalk to the corner. 

The crew shared a small apartment in a large complex. So many dumpsters. They didn't even try to hide them. Cars were parked everywhere. Orderly, in spaces, but again, like the dumpsters, there were so many cars. Walking around this place alone at night always made my stomach sick and my balls tingle. I stopped, turned around, and walked.

Corner to sidewalk to driveway to steps to porch. 

I was back at the apartment where I opened the door slowly, silently. I was nervous, I guess. There wasn't really a good way to say this, but I had to poop. So, I did. I then brushed my teeth slowly, shook the water off the toothbrush and put it into my pocket. I walked silently down the hall to the kitchen where I grabed my phone charger and stuffed it in my pocket. I climbed on the counter to reach far behind the refrigerator and up into the crack between the cabinet and wall. I found it. My envelope. My savings. All the cash I had. In seconds I was at the front door. I silenced my phone and put it in airplane mode.

Again, porch to steps to driveway to sidewalk to the corner. 

The moon was higher in the sky. Fucking moon. It hung there and looked over us with its fat, white, judging face. It came and went as it pleased, cowered behind clouds in storms. It didn't even make its own light. It just reflected. Whatever, fucking moon.

I had a plan, I guess.

I was not very good at sleeping which is why I took walks on so many nights. The subdivision next to the apartments was a big one whose houses were built in the sixties or seventies. They all had three bedrooms and a garage and were either a ranch or a 2 story. Some houses were set on the lot at 90 degrees which made it almost seem like there were four different floor plans. There weren't. There were 172 ranch homes and 97 two-story. 212 were 100% siding. One was stucco. The rest had some brick but were mostly siding. 57 homes were on larger lots that allowed for either a two car garage or 1 car garage plus a dining room. If you took a walk around there you'd get a pretty good idea the builder wasn't up for giving the buyers too many options.

Over the years, people had added on porches, window treatments, landscaping, and decks but it was hard to get any sense of individuality in that neighborhood. I pretended everyone inside those houses were exactly the same.

The area around there was completely flat. There were no walk-out basements. However, some people has a basement door installed. They dug a hole, formed concrete stairs and added a small drain at the bottom to catch the rain. I liked how flat the neighborhood was because some nights I would run. Runners seemed to be less suspicious and I liked that.

That night I was headed to 5678 Pine Street whose porch light burned out late last month. I arrived and did a quick 360 to see if anyone was watching. No one was. I sprinted around the side next to the garage and sat up against the house.

There, I waited. The woman who lived here tended to get home late and she was more into cats than dogs. I looked at my phone. It was just after midnight and she still wasn't home. I sat cross legged, or Indian style as they said in elementary school which gave me some fantods so I lie supine and then semi-supine parallel to the house; against the house.

A mosquito buzzes in my ear and my balls are tingling and my heart rate is up and i hear a truck and the garage door opens. Headlights flash on the neighbors house and disappear as her blue Ford Explorer rumbles and squeaks its way into the garage. I roll to my hands and knees and crawl quickly to the corner of her house. I peek around the corner and catch the taillight as her truck finishes going in. I follow it in on the passenger side staying low and moving quickly with my head up to watch the mirror making sure I'm not in it. She keeps hers pointed high so I'm in the clear. The truck stops and she clicks it into park and I roll underneath. The exhaust is 2" from my face and the heat from the catalytic converter is almost burning my left leg. The truck turns off and I hear her shuffling for her purse or bags or whatever. I don't care. I don't move.

The exhaust snaps and pops in my ear as it cools.

She steps out of her truck and slams the door. Not a very dainty girl, this one. She drags her left foot a bit. Her shoes clip, clop and slide 12 steps where she stops. She pulls open the door to her house, hits the garage door opener, shuts off the light and slams the door. She is gone but I can't tell 100% if she locked it behind her.

I slip from under the truck. I'm sweaty and my back is dusty and it is completely dark. I can't see anything and I have to be extremely careful not to make any noise. After all these years, I'm pretty good at it. I sit up and take off my t-shirt and pull out my phone. I use it as a flashlight as brush the dust off my shirt. There is no grease and that makes me happy. I double check my phone. It is still in airplane mode. I find a bare spot on the wall where I can lean and sit quietly and in the dark and sit and breathe.

And sit for an hour.

And sit for another hour.

I feel good. It is time so I get up and put on my shirt. This garage and the house is completely quiet. I am quiet, relaxed, clean and dry. I walk around the truck 16 steps to the door using my phone for a flashlight. With my hand around the knob I pause. I don't know if you've noticed, but pretty much every door knob has some play in it. A light click as the mechanism engages. So, I twist slowly and just a bit until it catches. I still haven't made a sound. This is good.

She didn't lock the door. That makes me happy. I twist the knob just enough to get the door to open and push slowly. It doesn't squeak. That makes me happy. I'm in her kitchen. The light is on over the sink. It looks dim like a single 40 watt light bulb covered in a dusty fixture that has been hanging in a kitchen for 25 years. The glass seems slightly browned, maybe. I imagine taking the damp dishrag that is hanging off the faucet, running some warm, soapy water in the sink while carefully dismantling this light fixture. I take it off the ceiling. Soak its parts for a while. I imagine myself and some soapy water scrubbing years of sticky off that light so it can glow a clean, white light again.

I look to the left. There's her purse. They always throw them down right by the door. In the purse: wallet, girl shit, and keys. That makes me happy. The litter box is next to the door. Fuck that. I slip her keys out of this ridiculously large, fake brown leather bag. Her key ring is equally ridiculous. So many keys and fucking picture frames and souvenirs and crap carabiners that couldn't support Kate Moss. It is hard to keep the mess quiet, but my hands are big. There is a course listing for some nights school sitting here. bent backward at the spine with blue ink pen circling the words, "Pre-Nursing Workshop," over and over again to where the paper was almost worn through.

I left the kitchen door open, I always do. I go through the doorway and I'm in the garage, again. Now that there's a little light, I notice a bike leaning against the wall. I need that. I close the door silently behind me. And use my phone as a flashlight, again. As quietly as I can, I put the bike in the truck. I slip the truck key off the ring and carefully set the mess of keys and rings et al. on the ground for her. No need to hassle her any more than I already have. I walk around and open the driver's door, quickly shutting off the dome light.

I'm standing on the door sill, now. I can reach the garage door opener's manual release from here so I pull it slowly and it pops a little louder than they usually do. I'm out of the truck now and at the garage door.

There's no question about it. Garage doors are fucking loud. There's pretty much no way to open one without making noise. The trick here is to go slow. Think you're going slow? Go slower. However, we're facing the street so we should be moving as fast as possible. I don't want to be hanging out where any car driving by can see me so I'm hoping no one drives by.

No one does.

I'm back in the truck.

Door closed.

Key on.

Neutral.

Key off... Well, no. Duh. you can't turn the key off in an automatic unless it is in park. I can't open the door with they key in the ignition without the warning chime banging to let everyone know I'm there.

Fuck.

Window down. Truck in park. Key off.

I get out. I reach in the window to turn the key on. Now, a big stretch to get it in neutral. Son of a bitch. You can't put a car in neutral without a foot on the brake.

I'm out of practice.

The garage door is hanging open, I'm futzing around like an idiot. I'm stealing a truck. Every time I put it in park or neutral I hit the brakes. That means the brake lights are flashing through the open garage door like beacons. Nice. I look around. There's a piece of 2x4 that's about 4' long. I lift the front bumper (and the truck) as much as I can and wedge the wood underneath. I grab a lawn furniture cushion and put it underneath.

That'll work.

I'm back in the truck. Key on. Foot on brake. Neutral. Foot off the brake. I bounce backward against the seat like a little kid trying to get the shopping cart to roll and it goes. The truck is moving. Fuck this flat-assed subdivision. The 2x4 hit squarely on the cushion. Not a sound.

Half way down the driveway I open the door. The chime is going nuts, but I should be good now. I hop out and start pushing. Down the driveway, on to the street, a left turn and I'm in front of the neighbor's house. I start the truck, throw it in drive and go. I'm confident she didn't wake up. No one usually notices until the morning, anyway, and no one saw me. Poor girl.

I'm driving 2 mph above the speed limit. Stopping at stop signs, but not lagging. Right on red? Why not, but only after coming to a complete stop. I worry about traffic cameras and anything else that may catch my face. Cameras are everywhere and I know there are three for every one I notice. Stores, businesses, Department of Transportation… Whatever. I stop to tell myself that this is a stolen car, not a murder but I am still very careful.

What's the next thing on the agenda? Find another Ford Explorer with the same body style as this one.

I drive through neighborhoods. I choose subdivisions that are dense with cars and have small houses that are close together and maybe a little ratty. You always try to steal a common car so you can do this:

I spot a red Ford Explorer that looks a lot like the one I'm in. I park one street over where there are no lights. I slip out, unscrew the license plates from my truck and hop fences and run until i'm underneath the red truck. I lie underneath because no one driving by notices someone under a car. They do, however, notice some Mexican guy hunched over behind a car stealing its plates. No one drives by, tonight. I have the red truck's plates in my hand. My trucks are in their place. I roll from under the truck, run, and hop more fences until I'm at my truck. I put the plates on and drive off.

Now I'm on the highway. 62 mph in a 60. I don't know of one person who has noticed their license plates got swapped until they get pulled over and are on the ground getting cuffed for driving a stolen car. That means I'm driving a truck with plates that are completely legit and probably will be for at least a few days. My odds are better, now. I'm finally relaxed and I'm guessing this thing holds about 20 gallons of gas. The gauge reads 3/4 of a tank. These things probably get about 16 mpg. That's 240 miles. The black sky is lightening up a bit. 240 miles is plenty.

I'll make it.

And suddenly, I am here.

I drive up a long gravel driveway, slowly. The day has broken but the fog is still here and the gravel pops and snaps and pings against the bottom of this girl's truck. The driveway is flanked by scrawny woods filled with invasive species that are choking out the cedars and elms. I get to the patch of Paper Birch (Betula papyrifera) and now I'm back being a kid coming up here for the week and using the birch as a landmark. The birches meant we were here after that brutal, eleven hour drive. The woods quickly end and now I'm driving up to the white wood siding house that sits alone in an open field. The house is in good repair, but it could use some paint, a little landscaping, and new shingles. It is a two story farmhouse that looks as if it was missing its wood shutters and a porch, even thought it never had either. I always thought a wrap-around porch with a screened-in area out back would suit the house perfectly. Instead, there is a simple, blue door at ground-level and six plain white windows with a worn out grey roof and mildew and a wasps nest under the single bulb light that hung over the door.

I keep driving.

A sharp right turn through a grown-in entrance to the woods. Downhill. Switching left and right until I'm at the gigantic pole barn that sits low and flat nuzzled in these trees like it grew along with them. Or, maybe like it pushed its way here, invading the trees' space like kudzu and honeysuckle. I put the truck in park, turn it off, and get out. The air is thick and cool, sun is heating tree tops and the barn's dark, moldy roof. I stretch and realize I'm hungry, now. Just like that, you get in a place and can suddenly feel again. I start remembering, too:

I've played a little game since I was a kid. I like to look at people. People on the street. People sitting in the subway. Saleswomen pushing cheap furniture. Tired men cleaning toilets. I like to look at them and try to understand what they see when they close their eyes. I imagine all the places they go. I pretend to know all the things in their head they see when they're all alone.

I have a plan. I will go up to that farm house, open some sort of canned food, sit at that old computer and show you exactly what happens when I close my eyes.

This is what I see.

This is to a girl.

Madison.
