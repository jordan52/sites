If I had to answer the question, I would point to my own lack of success as a performing musician and the friends and colleagues I've seen who have had success, and by success I mean, they are able to play music they like and enjoy playing, they don't have to hold down a day job and compromise is minimal. The difference I've observed is that successful musicians set goals, and those goals are ambitious, achievable and measurable. It's scary to set goals and commit to the them because what if you fail? What if you get tired of those songs you wrote? What if you are inspired to take up electro-polka? You commit to your goals and see them through, even when you're not completely inspired. You hold off on the immediate gratification of playing with that new guitar pedal because you know if you stick to your release schedule that will be more gratifying in the long run.

Money and fans are part of that equation, there's no getting around that. You can't just bury your head in the sand and pretend you live in some artistic utopia where musicians just get food and shelter because they're so awesome. If you don't make a significant income from your music, you will need to work a day job, so less time for music, music will likely not be as amazing. Same goes for being able to purchase equipment, pay for studio time, mastering, etc. Those things do make a difference and Andrew W.K. would not just shrug it off if you took all his money and resources away from him. A lot of what he's talking about is an imagined dichotomy between money and spiritual success- the fact that you are making money as a musician means in many cases that you are providing some spiritual value and some inspiration for your fans. They're not mutually exclusive.

Passion and inspiration will only take you so far. At some point you have to try and build something, organize a concerted and prolonged assault on the music business if you want to gain the kind of momentum it takes to have a career as a performing musician. It's not magic, I've seen people with average-decent amount of talent pull it off to varying degrees.


on making good programming vs making good business:

I think that sometimes we need to really meditate what we read, in this case i think AWK answered the question correctly a successful musician plays music successfully and a successful business man makes successful business
So a perfect TL;DR from him is practice your music and practice your business.
This last years a have find out that in order to sell your music you dont need to be a good musician, just take a look at all that horrible pop music nowdays making millions it is all about the marketing and thats it.
Being a good musician is to fulfill your inner self and to tell stories and concepts and change minds and all things magic.
So this is a lesson in balance, if we really want to become sucesfull musicians we have to create a balance in between play(making music) and work (selling the music) , we are neither pop monopoly mascots thinking bout money all day and also we are not hedonist divas dreaming of music eating melodies and drinking harmonies why people around him pays the real bills

on making a persona. i'm interested in the programmers who might be personas - the javascript guy who moved to go 
recently, the other guy who fell off the face of the earth:

Andrew W.K. was created by a large group of people. They met, and I was there, and we talked about how we could come up with something that would move people. It was done in the spirit of commerce. It was done in the spirit of entertainment, which usually goes hand in hand with commerce. I was auditioned, along side many other people, to fill this role of a 'great frontman', 'a great performer'. On the one hand it may be a little scary to admit this to you all, that I may not be exactly who you thought I was, and that the guy who was, in fact, first hired as Andrew W.K. is a different person than the guy sitting here on the stage tonight. I'm the next person who is playing Andrew W.K.
