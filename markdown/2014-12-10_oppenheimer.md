Robert Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist and is generally known as the father of the atomic bomb. 
 He once said the first atomic explosion reminded him of a
verse 
from a 
hindu holy book that said, "If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, 
that would be like the splendor of the mighty one."

Later, when asked about the moment on television, his profound response was, 

<blockquote>"We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were 
silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that 
he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer 
of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another."</blockquote>

Wow, right? What an amazing, smart person. But, you know what? His brother, Frank, 
was there with him at the Trinity site. He said Robert simply exclaimed, "It worked!" Brigadier General Thomas Farrell 
was also in the control bunker with him. He said that the second the bomb went off, 
Oppenheimer's face relaxed into  an expression of tremendous relief.
