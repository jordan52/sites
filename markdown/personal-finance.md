(Again, this is a work in progress... Why do I keep publishing things before they're done????)


I want to get better at tracking wealth. I have a spreadsheet that I update once a quarter that tracks what I own, owe,
and (doh! I can't think of a clever o-word to use here.) I would like to build something that monitors those things in
almost real time (daily updates at least) and goes a little deeper than cash value. That is, for each asset, I would
like to know:

* the resource's allocation
  - stock
    * large cap
    * mid cap
    * small cap
    * foreign
  - bond
  - cash (USD)
  - foreign equity
  - real estate
  - insurance
  - private equity
  - personal asset
  - liability
    * mortgage
    * some other loans?
* where it sits
  - IRA
  - ROTH
  - health spending
  - investment account
  - bank
* when it was purchased and when it will end
  - basis (this gets complicated when you, for example, purchase more shares of the same stock. I guess just treat it
like a brand new stock at that point. What about splits?
  - the ending date for things like a CD
* what kind of returns for known accounts
  - bank rates
  
So, yeah, this gets complicated if you let it. I'm not sure if I should continue down the path of a spreadsheet or throw
together a project. Getting daily updates for stocks and funds makes me thing an app is the route I need to take.

Until then!
