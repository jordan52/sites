I wanted to build a wireless arduino temperature logger. Well, I did. Except it was a rasberry pi and it logged to 
google drive. it was awesome. BUT! i lost the code. No worries, though. I'm putting a reminder right here for me to
<blockquote>
LOOK IN SCRIVENER/ROBOTICS. YOUR NOTES ARE THERE. PASTE THEM HERE
</blockquote>

thank you for playing.
