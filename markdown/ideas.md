(this is a work in progress and a joke)

Today I saw a post where a guy was showing off his fully-formed idea for a physical product. It was 1/12th scale concrete blocks. Flippin' genius. I have also been spending a lot of time reading about lifestyle businesses (concrete blocks), sites, and apps that generate recurring revenue. This is an exercise in thinking about ideas that could possibly generate revenue.
