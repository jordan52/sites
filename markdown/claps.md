Claps is an unreleased hand clap generator that uses random normals to drift hand claps to give them a natural sound.
The app allows you to configure the distribution, bpm, and number of actors (clappers.) Configure the pan and volume
for each clapper. Of course, volume is not a value, but a distribution.
  
If you want to generate applause, simply set the number of actors to a distribution instead of a constant.
 
Claps is a command line app that generates an MP3 stream as output.
