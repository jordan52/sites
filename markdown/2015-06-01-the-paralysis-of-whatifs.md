Of my friends and colleagues who have had success (where success means they are able to develop in the languages and frameworks they like the best while being able to hold down a job or book of business where compromise is minimal) I have noticed that they differ from “unsuccessful” dev in that they are able to set ambitious, achievable, and measurable goals, see them through to the end where that end is defined as a usable piece of software that installs and runs with minimal fuss. Whether it be a library, framework, or app, it provides a good percentage of wanted functionality out of the box.

What stops more dev from being successful? I think a big part of it is fear. Setting goals and committing to them is scary. What if you fail? What if a new language shows up or a cool new framework? There is this fear of missing out or falling behind that is pervasive in our industry. What if you work on the wrong thing and no one cares? What if you get tired and abandon the project before it is ready?

Here is what my successful friends do - They commit to their goals and see them through no matter how many what-ifs they make up along the way. They hold off on the immediate gratification of learning a new language or switching out frameworks, or trying that fancy new editor because they know that sticking to their release schedule is more gratifying in the long run.

Money and popularity are a part of the success equation, no doubt about it. You cannot bury your head in the sand and pretend you live in some dev utopia where you get food and shelter just because you are awesome. With that said, if you don’t make a significant income from your project, you will most certainly have to work a day job. This takes time and energy away from your project so your project will not be as good and therefore will have a higher probability of failure. That’s why you must try to make money from your project.

Imagine it this way - the fact that your project is making money means that it (or you) are providing some real value and inspiration to your users. This is about the most pure (i.e. bullshit proof) metric that exists. And, in some ways, one of the best tests you could possibly write. In fact, I always have a test called generates_cash_flow_test() in my harness.

Excitement and passion will only take you so far. At some point you have to build something and see it through to the end. Organize a concentrated and prolonged assault on business and do everything you can to gain and maintain momentum. This stuff is not magic - grind it out until you have your success.
