There has been a lot of talk about unicorns lately, or, at least, I'm getting a nice Baader-Meinhof phenomenon for 
unicorns. At any rate, I think Aswath nicely illustrates some fuckery that can be done in valuation during an up
round. It is nicely explained here:

And then there is this analysis of biotech unicorns and the idea that maybe it is better to invest in a basket rather
than one:

In that article there is a link to a slideshare that, in fact comes from a bennedict evans post. You might as well
check out the source becasue there's a podcast there, too:

fascinating stuff.
