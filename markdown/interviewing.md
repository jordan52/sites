(this is a work in progress)

Do:

* sign up for everything the company has to offer. Try to understand why they do what they do.
* visit their web site and the sites of their competitors
* learn as much as you can about the people who will be interviewing you. Stalk the shit out of them.
* make notes on things they can change. If you're interviewing for a marketing position, 
try to get into their sales funnel and see how they operate.
* follow up after the interview with an email and/or a hand-written thank you.
* in that email, map out the first 30 days should you get hired.

Don't:

* whine about your previous job or co workers
* bad mouth any other applicants
* use racial or homophobic slurs (yes, i have seen this happen more than once)
