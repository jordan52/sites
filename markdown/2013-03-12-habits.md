[Habits](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)  habit loop: cue, action/routine, reward 

most cues fit into one of five categories: location, time, emotional state, other people or the immediately preceding action

1. where are you?
2. what time is it? 
3. what is your emotional state? (bored, sad, happy, etc.)
4. who else is around?
5. what action preceded the urge?
