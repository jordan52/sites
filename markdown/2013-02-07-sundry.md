My toynbee tile has not survived the winter.

This <http://selectadecision.info/> is a cold war era russian choose your own adventure type game.

I pulled this next thing out of my checklist doc (private) because it doesn't belong there. It belongs here:

Things to remember:

*  Kanban Board <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board>
*  Watch "The 400 Blows" <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_400_Blows>
*  This guy is a good photog <http://mrelllis.tumblr.com/>
*  This is a good forum thread <http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php?/topic/33420-style-inspiration/page__st__2310>
*  Learn more about superfuture.com

The superfuture thing comes from something I read on /r/malefashionadvice regarding a boot choice and the fact that yes, someone could pull it off, but "you'd have to be so ridiculously on point you probably wouldn't be on MFA in the first place" and then someone mentioned superfuture and I went there and kind of get it but not really.
