I knew the day would come when someone would say, "Tricky Keg Stands? Really?" I didn't have a plan for what I'd do 
next, though. It has been nearly a year and I still do not. On one hand, I want to keep trickykegstands and just own 
it. On the other hand, it feels like it is time for something new. I am definitely overthinking it, 
but that's what I do. Also, there are so many domain names available I can't decide on something new. Let's 
start with the ones I already own.

* **armp.it** - By far my favorite domain. Can't use it.
* **fiftytwo.net** - My first domain. Too boring.
* **fiftytwodesign.(com|net)** - equally as boring.
* **isthepatentsystembroken.com** - yes
* **yakbuttertea.com** - i wasn't drunk i swear.
* **(men|women)(facing|seeking)divorce.com** - unused
* **androidindie.com** - should have become a mobile dev.

I want to do some industrial automation work. If I do, I will name the company *Standard Automata, 
Inc.* I bought standardautomata.com and thought, hey, that's kind of a mouthful but it still might make a good name. 
Then I was going to change my twitter name to standardautomata. Sad trombone... too many letters. The best one I can 
find is standardautoma... but that sounds like hematoma.  stndrdautomata? i don't love it.
  
So, yeah, I've got nothing. Should I keep trickykegstands?
