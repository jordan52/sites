I was just about to close these tabs:

<https://github.com/scoofy/wxStocks/blob/master/wxStocks.py> is done by a guy on a few forums who likes to mention this code. I'd like to try to use it. It is a python app that scrapes yahoo and morningstar to get data about companies. Might be a good stock screener?

and this is a fair way to do equity? <https://medium.com/this-time-is-different/12ddebcc63ef>
