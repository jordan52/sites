I doubt any of this will be better than "Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" by John Hull (i'm eeking my way through that right now) but a guy on reddit wrote a free book, i downloaded it (look for a file called developingOptionsIntuition.pdf) he linked to a good set of comments on reddit explaining options from the beginning <http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pigr5/optionstrading_102_past_the_basics/> here is the original link <http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/239ncq/i_wrote_a_draft_of_an_intermediateadvanced_book/> and a complete list of the comments that explain options
