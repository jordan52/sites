#### OJ drowned Ele and ran.

I can't take credit for this little gem. I picked the letters of my name
out of a set of scrabble tiles and left them on the kitchen table with a
note that said, "Make a sentence." Someone did. It just so happened to
be the week of [June 17th,
1994](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case#The_slow-speed_chase).

Ele is my nickname for Ella who, of course, is my good friend, Umbrella.
ella ella ay ay... ay... ella.
