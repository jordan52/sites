Do you know anything about real analysis and measure theory? I was thinking about a gambling problem I couldn't figure out and dug in to find out why. I still don't have an answer, but I learned that measure theory isn't as scary as I thought. If you don't know anything about it, these are two, very accessible introductions:

why use measure theory for probability part 1 - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjPXfUT7Odo&feature=player_embedded>

intro to brownian motion and the ito integral part 1 - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEsnMyi5-8k&list=PLC7A868A384F6EFF0>

here is the guy from the first video

A really simple intro to financial math from a cs teacher
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1BaGV1cIH4UXkZgrX2TtXhvUQW6_4hZF>

he also has a site for these videos, might want to check out the probablility refreshers for FE's:

this all started from some guy's comments about measure theory on this "how to quant" HN post <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8698986>

I want to do a calc refresher. Here are some resources for doing that:

Mathematics: Its Content, Methods and Meaning - preview on books.google.com available at Olin Level B Stacks QA36 A453 in all three parts. And it is only $25 on amazon <http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Content-Methods-Meaning-Dover/dp/0486409163/>

And also i should read Sheldon Axler's "Linear Algebra Done Right"
