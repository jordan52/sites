				h2  I'm Jordan. I do things.
				p.
					I don't want to sell you an e-book. I don't want you to subscribe to my newsletter and I don't want to
					teach you how to go from zero to 10,000 viewers in 30 days. However, I do want share my ideas for doing
					good work, building interesting things, and generally succeeding in this thing we call life.
				p.
					I am a dad, an entrepreneur, a software engineer, and a wanna be writer. I spend most of my time
					teaching, coding, writing music, and pulling myself through projects I probably had no business trying. In
					fact, I do a whole lot of things and I make a lot of mistakes along the way. I'm hoping this site can
					to teach you some tricks that will help you get good at the things you want to do.
